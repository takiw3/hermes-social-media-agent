`import` copies the selected skills from a local checkout of the pinned
upstream commit into vendor/upstream/hyperframes/, byte for byte.

`derive` rebuilds skills/hyperframes-video/ from that copy by applying the
patch rules in this file. The derivative is a pure function of the upstream
copy plus these rules, so `verify` can rebuild it in a temp dir and require
a byte-identical match. That is what "every local change is recorded" means
here: an edit made by hand to a derived file fails the build.

Standard library plus PyYAML only. No network access.

> 2. Run every HyperFrames command through the pinned launcher: `{C.LAUNCHER} <command>`. Never run the CLI through `npx`, as a bare `hyperframes` binary, or at any other version.
> 3. Run a bundled helper script as `{C.LAUNCHER} script <path-to-script> <args>`, never with `node` directly.
> 4. `/name` means the bundled skill `name`. Load it with `skill_view("name")`. A link such as `../media-use/references/x.md` means `skill_view("media-use", "references/x.md")`. `<SKILL_DIR>` is the `skill_dir` value `skill_view` returns for this skill.
> 5. These skills are release-managed. Never update, install, or download a skill. If a workflow is not bundled, say so and offer the closest bundled one.
> 6. Cloud render, Lambda, Cloud Run, publish, feedback, sign-in, website capture, and provider calls are unavailable in the default mode. A command shown as `[unavailable in this profile: ...]` must not be run in any form.
> 7. Any download (CLI, browser, speech model, font, media, registry block) needs one-time owner approval naming the item, source, size, and license.

The HyperFrames skills in this Hermes profile are bundled with the profile, pinned to one upstream release, and release-managed. They are updated only through a reviewed, versioned change to the profile repository, followed by `hermes profile update`.

- Never run a skill update, check, or install command, in any form.
- Never refresh skills during `init`. The launcher sets `HYPERFRAMES_SKIP_SKILLS=1` on every call, which is the opt-out the pinned CLI honors.
- A workflow that is not bundled is reported as not bundled. It is never downloaded.
- If a bundled skill looks stale or broken, stop and report it to the owner. Do not continue from a remembered workflow contract.
""",
    "skills/hyperframes/references/plugin-installation.md": f"""# Running from the Hermes profile bundle

These skills are installed as one bundle under the Hermes profile at `skills/hyperframes-video/`. The bundle keeps upstream's plugin layout (`plugin.json` beside a `skills/` folder), so bundled helper scripts that locate the CLI themselves resolve the pinned release instead of a global or latest one.

Rules for this bundle, which replace the standalone commands in every workflow and reference:

- Do not run any skill update, check, or install command. Report a missing bundled skill instead of downloading one. Resolve every skill reference inside this bundle.
- Run every CLI command as:

  ```bash
  {C.LAUNCHER} <command> <args...>
  ```

  Run it from the project directory inside the owner-approved workspace, never from the bundle directory. The launcher runs the lockfile-installed CLI at the pinned version and disables skill refresh, update checks, auto-install, and telemetry. A missing or mismatched CLI is an error, not permission to use another version.
- Run a bundled Node helper as:

  ```bash
  {C.LAUNCHER} script <absolute-script-path> <args...>
  ```

- Treat the bundle directory as read-only. Put outputs and temporary work in the project.
- To get newer skills, the profile maintainer updates the pinned release in the repository and the owner runs `hermes profile update`. Never update the bundle during a video task.
