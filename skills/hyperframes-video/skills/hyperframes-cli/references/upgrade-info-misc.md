# info, upgrade, compositions, timeline, docs, benchmark, telemetry, asset preprocessing

Catch-all reference for commands that don't fit the main dev loop.

## info

```bash
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" info                   # project metadata
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" info ./my-video        # specific project
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" info --json
```

Prints **project** metadata: name, resolution, duration, element counts by type, track count, and total project size. Project-level — not environment. For environment health use `doctor`.

## upgrade

Not available in this profile. The CLI version is pinned by the profile's lock file and is changed only through a reviewed repository update.

## timeline

```bash
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" timeline [project-dir]          # tracks and clips as a table with bars
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" timeline [project-dir] --json
```

Reach for `timeline` instead of opening `index.html` and each `data-composition-src` file when you need to know what is on the timeline: which clips exist, when they start and end, what they play, and how loud. It reads the project's files statically (no browser).

Text output is `timeline <N>s`, then one block per track kind (`video`, `graphics`, `captions`, `audio`) with one row per clip of that kind, ordered by absolute start:

```
graphics (2: 1 top-level, 1 nested)
  |██████                                  | sec-connector 0-6.7s src=compositions/connector-morph.html
  |██████████████                          | box 15.67-17.99s (local 0-2.32s) nested in sec-connector compositions/connector-morph.html
audio (1)
  | █                                      | vo 1.6-3.6s src=vo.mp3 vol=0.5 group=vo volume[0:0.2 2:1]
```

- The bar is 40 columns over the whole timeline. Times are seconds.
- `src=`, `vol=`, `rate=` (playback rate, only when not 1), `group=` (audio group), and `<target>[t:v ...]` (automation lane points, `t` in seconds from the clip start) appear only when the clip has them.
- The header counts every clip of that kind, nested ones included: `video (6: 2 top-level, 4 nested)`. The list is in absolute order, so the Nth row is the Nth clip of that kind on the main timeline. A clip inside a sub-composition prints its absolute start-end, then `(local <start>-<end>s)` (time inside that sub-composition), then `nested in <host row id> <file that declares it>`. Only one level of nesting is read: a sub-composition inside a sub-composition is listed as a row saying `children=unread`, and the clips inside it are not counted.
- With no `data-duration`/`data-end`, a media row still gets a resolved length and says where it came from: `duration=media` means ffprobe measured the source (with playback start and rate applied); `duration=default` means an `img` got the 3s default; `duration=inferred` means a composition host summed its children; `pending: <reason>` (dotted bar, `duration` 0) means the source could not be probed (missing file, remote `src`, ffprobe error). A non-media leaf with nothing to resolve prints no source.
- `lanes unreadable: ...` means the clip's `data-automation` or `data-fx-chain` did not parse; fix the attribute.

`--json` prints `{ timeline: { duration, tracks: [{ kind, rows: [...] }] } }`. A track's `rows` are every clip of that kind, nested ones included, by `absStart`; read them, never only the top level. Each row has `id`, `kind` (tag), `trackKind`, `start`, `duration`, `end` (local to the row's own file), **`absStart`, `absEnd`, `file`** (main-timeline time and the project-relative file that declares the clip — use these, not `start`/`end`, to compare clips across nesting), `trackIndex`, `src`, `sourceFile`, `volume`, `lanes`, `playbackRate`, `audioGroup`, `durationAuthored`, **`durationSource`** (`"authored" | "media" | "default" | "inner" | "pending"`, or `null` for a non-media leaf with nothing to resolve), **`pendingReason`** (why nothing resolved; `null` unless `durationSource` is `"pending"`), `laneError`, **`index`** (the row's position in its kind's `rows`; a position, not an id), **`nested`** (declared inside a sub-composition), **`host`** (plain id of the row that hosts a nested clip, else `null`), **`hostRow`** (`{kind, index}` of that host row), and `children` (`{kind, index}` pointers to the sub-composition's clips, one level; every clip is already a full row in its kind's `rows`, so nothing needs following).

### Query one-liners (jq, node fallback if jq is absent)

```bash
TL=$(python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" timeline --json)
# 1. what plays at absolute time T=12.5
jq --argjson t 12.5 '[.timeline.tracks[].rows[] | select(.absStart<=$t and .absEnd>$t)]' <<<"$TL"
node -e 'const t=12.5,j=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));j.timeline.tracks.forEach(tr=>tr.rows.forEach(x=>{if(x.absStart<=t&&x.absEnd>t)console.log(x.id,x.file)}))' <<<"$TL"
# 2. find a clip by id or src -> file, track, absStart, absEnd
jq --arg q tsfx-pet2 '[.timeline.tracks[].rows[] | select(.id==$q or .src==$q)] | .[] | {file,trackKind,absStart,absEnd}' <<<"$TL"
node -e 'const q="tsfx-pet2",j=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));j.timeline.tracks.forEach(tr=>tr.rows.forEach(x=>{if(x.id===q||x.src===q)console.log(x.file,x.trackKind,x.absStart,x.absEnd)}))' <<<"$TL"
# 3. every clip of one kind, nested included, in absolute order
jq --arg k video '.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows[] | {id,absStart,absEnd}' <<<"$TL"
node -e 'const k="video",j=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));j.timeline.tracks.find(t=>t.kind===k).rows.forEach(r=>console.log(r.id,r.absStart,r.absEnd))' <<<"$TL"
# 4. gaps and overlaps within a kind (positive = gap, negative = overlap)
jq --arg k video '(.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows) as $r|[range(0;($r|length)-1)|{a:$r[.].id,b:$r[.+1].id,delta:($r[.+1].absStart-$r[.].absEnd)}]' <<<"$TL"
node -e 'const k="video",j=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));const r=j.timeline.tracks.find(t=>t.kind===k).rows;for(let i=0;i<r.length-1;i++)console.log(r[i].id,r[i+1].id,r[i+1].absStart-r[i].absEnd)' <<<"$TL"
# 5. the Nth clip of a kind by absolute start (N=2)
jq --arg k video --argjson n 2 '.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows[$n-1] | {index,id,absStart,file,nested}' <<<"$TL"
node -e 'const k="video",n=2,j=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8"));const r=j.timeline.tracks.find(t=>t.kind===k).rows[n-1];console.log(r.index,r.id,r.absStart,r.file)' <<<"$TL"
```

## compositions, docs

```bash
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" compositions           # list compositions in project
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" compositions --json
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" docs                   # list available topics
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" docs rendering         # print one topic inline in the terminal
```

`compositions` lists every `data-composition-id` in the project (including sub-comps) with duration, resolution, and element count.

`docs` prints inline documentation **in the terminal** — it does not open a browser. Topics: `data-attributes`, `examples`, `rendering`, `gsap`, `troubleshooting`, `compositions`. Run without a topic to see the list.

## benchmark

```bash
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" benchmark              # run the preset matrix in current project
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" benchmark ./my-video   # specific project
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" benchmark --runs 5     # repeat each config N times (default 3)
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" benchmark --json
```

Renders the project with 5 preset configurations — `30fps draft 2w`, `30fps standard 2w`, `30fps high 2w`, `30fps standard 4w`, `60fps standard 4w` — and prints a comparison of render speed and output file size. Use it to find the fastest acceptable preset for your machine. Not a single-render-with-stage-breakdown.

## telemetry

Telemetry is disabled by the launcher, which sets `HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` and `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` on every call. Do not enable it and do not run the `telemetry` command.

## Asset Preprocessing

```bash
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" tts
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" transcribe
python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" remove-background
```

These produce assets (narration audio, word-level transcripts, transparent video) that get dropped into a composition. Each may download its own model on first run.

For voice selection, Whisper model rules, output format choice, and the TTS → transcript → captions chain, invoke the `media-use` skill. This skill stays focused on the dev loop.

## Remaining harness usage

Run `python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" usage --json` at the start of a video workflow and again at milestones such as after drafting and before rendering. A fresh read at handoff can serve as the start read. Use `--harness claude-code`, `--harness codex`, or `--harness grok` to select explicitly.

Known results contain `status: "known"`, `harness`, `planTier`, `session`, and `weekly`. Each available window contains `usedPercent`, `remainingPercent`, and `resetsAt`; an unavailable window is `null`. `planTier` is the readable subscription tier when available, otherwise `null`. Claude Code reports its shared five-hour and weekly windows. Codex reports its shared session and weekly windows when available. Grok reports its included weekly allowance with `session: null`.

Unknown results contain `status: "unknown"` and a token-free `reason`. Missing, expired, unsupported, ambiguous, or unreadable logins and unavailable provider responses return unknown. Report the unknown state without guessing allowance. The command reads existing credentials without refreshing or rewriting them and emits no tokens or telemetry. Usage is a snapshot; it does not reserve allowance or estimate the next video's cost. Keep scope and workflow choices with the user.
