  Mandatory entry point: read this first for any request to make, create, edit, animate, or render a
  video, animation, or motion graphic, including a promo, explainer, captioned clip, title card,
  overlay, slideshow or interactive deck, Remotion port, or any HyperFrames HTML composition. Also
  use it to inspect, diagnose, validate, preview, publish, or batch-render an existing HyperFrames
  project. Inputs may be a website URL, GitHub PR, Figma design or URL, text or brief, existing
  footage, or music. It resumes project state, captures intent when applicable, selects and installs
  the owning workflow, and routes domain capabilities. HyperFrames is the default output framework
  unless the user explicitly chooses another framework for the deliverable or asks only to record a
  browser session.

Rules applied: hermes-frontmatter, runtime-rules-banner, router-profile-rules, pin-cli. See skills/hyperframes-video/MODIFICATIONS.md.**

> **Profile runtime rules. These override anything below.**
>
> 1. Load the `social-hyperframes` skill first. It governs every HyperFrames call in this profile.
> 2. Run every HyperFrames command through the pinned launcher: `python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" <command>`. Never run the CLI through `npx`, as a bare `hyperframes` binary, or at any other version.
> 3. Run a bundled helper script as `python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" script <path-to-script> <args>`, never with `node` directly.
> 4. `/name` means the bundled skill `name`. Load it with `skill_view("name")`. A link such as `../media-use/references/x.md` means `skill_view("media-use", "references/x.md")`. `<SKILL_DIR>` is the `skill_dir` value `skill_view` returns for this skill.
> 5. These skills are release-managed. Never update, install, or download a skill. If a workflow is not bundled, say so and offer the closest bundled one.
> 6. Cloud render, Lambda, Cloud Run, publish, feedback, sign-in, website capture, and provider calls are unavailable in the default mode. A command shown as `[unavailable in this profile: ...]` must not be run in any form.
> 7. Any download (CLI, browser, speech model, font, media, registry block) needs one-time owner approval naming the item, source, size, and license.

**This bundle:** these skills are pinned and release-managed by the Hermes profile. There are no setup or freshness commands to run. See [bundle rules](references/plugin-installation.md).

# HyperFrames entry point

### Check remaining usage

The pinned CLI's `usage --json` command reports harness usage only for Claude Code, Codex, and Grok. Under Hermes it returns `status: unknown`. Report usage as unknown and do not guess an allowance. Keep scope and workflow choices with the owner.

HyperFrames **renders video from HTML** — a composition is an HTML file whose DOM declares timing with `data-*` attributes, whose animation runtime is seekable, and whose media playback is owned by the framework. The full authoring contract lives in `/hyperframes-core`; read it before writing composition HTML. Brief, storyboard, review, production, dispatch, and frame-worker contracts live in this skill's `references/`.

## 1. Start from project state

Apply the first matching row; do not evaluate lower state rows:

| State                                                                                                                         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit port of existing Remotion source to HyperFrames                                                                      | Read `references/routes/remotion-to-hyperframes.md`, then route directly to that workflow. Skip the intent layer.                                                                                                                      |
| Specific operation on an existing HyperFrames project: inspect, diagnose, validate, preview, render, publish, or batch-render | Perform only that operation. Skip intent and workflow routing; load `/hyperframes-cli` and any required domain skills.                                                                                                                 |
| A question, a hold, an idea with no concrete change, or a felt note on a built film, in an existing project                   | Follow `/hyperframes-studio` § 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| A new film asked for inside an existing project                                                                               | Follow `/hyperframes-studio` § 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Specific edit to an existing project                                                                                          | Make the edit. Do not run the intent layer. To know what is on a project's timeline (tracks, clips, starts, ends, what plays), run `python3 "$HERMES_HOME/skills/integrations/social-hyperframes/scripts/hf.py" timeline [--json]` instead of reading `index.html` and every sub-composition file. |
| `BRIEF.md` exists                                                                                                             | Read `workflow` and `flow`. Execute that workflow; `flow: companion` always executes in `/general-video`. Ask no brief questions.                                                                                                      |
| No brief, but `hyperframes.json` or `STORYBOARD.md` exists                                                                    | Resume from project files and recorded preferences. Infer the owning workflow from existing artifacts. If it cannot be determined uniquely, ask one routing-only question; do not run the intent interview.                            |
| Fresh creation                                                                                                                | Run the intent layer — `references/intent-interview.md` — then route once using § 2's table.                                                                                                                                           |

<!-- history (trial): remove this block together with the command -->

When you edit an existing project, bracket your edits with project history (`/hyperframes-cli`, Project history in your turn).

<!-- /history (trial) -->

If a fresh request does not identify the subject or input, ask what the video is about before routing. Check preferences and recipes before asking anything (`references/intent-interview.md`, step 1). A `figma.com` input or a named recipe changes intake, not routing — the interview's "Adapt orthogonal inputs" section handles both.

### Keep the project's CLI current

This profile pins one CLI version in a lock file and installs it from a lockfile with integrity hashes. Never run an upgrade probe, never run a different version, and never change a project's pinned version. If a project's `package.json` pins a version other than the profile's, stop and report both versions to the owner.

## 2. Route fresh creation

Use the first matching row. Match the requested **deliverable**, not a word or file type mentioned in passing.

| Priority | Request                                                                                                            | Workflow                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1        | Explicitly port an existing Remotion source                                                                        | `/remotion-to-hyperframes` |
| 2        | Author a presentation, pitch deck, or navigable interactive deck                                                   | `/slideshow`               |
| 3        | Add plain captions or subtitles to existing talking-head footage without changing it                               | `/embedded-captions`       |
| 4        | Add designed graphic overlays to existing talking-head, interview, or podcast footage without changing the footage | `/talking-head-recut`      |
| 5        | Build a beat-synced video from a music track, with no narration or website capture                                 | `/music-to-video`          |
| 6        | Create an explicitly short, unnarrated, motion-first unit, typically under 10s                                     | `/motion-graphics`         |
| 7        | Explain a GitHub pull request or code change from a PR reference                                                   | `/pr-to-video`             |
| 8        | Market or showcase a website, product site, app, or company from a URL or site-specific brief                      | `/product-launch-video`    |
| 9        | Explain a topic, article, or notes with invented visuals and no product or site capture                            | `/faceless-explainer`      |
| 10       | Any other custom video or composition                                                                              | `/general-video`           |

Before finalizing the route, read `references/routes/<workflow>.md` — one small file per route: the canonical input/output/trigger contract (available before lazy-installed workflow skills are present) plus that route's interview entry. If the candidate does not satisfy its contract, continue routing instead of forcing the match. Read only the matched route's file.

### Resolve common ambiguities

- A short animated title, logo sting, stat hit, chart hit, map hit, or standalone lower-third is `/motion-graphics` when it is unnarrated and motion is the message. A static title card, narrated sequence, longer montage, or custom loop is `/general-video`.
- An explicitly short motion graphic may use a URL, tweet, article, or screenshot as source material. A generic "make a video from this site" request is `/product-launch-video`.
- Existing footage with captions routes to `/embedded-captions`; footage with designed information cards routes to `/talking-head-recut`. Retiming, reordering, recoloring, reframing, or remixing footage is a custom edit and falls through to `/general-video`.
- A music file selects `/music-to-video` only when its beat grid drives the piece. Music used as a bed does not override the subject-matched route.
- "I want a storyboard" changes the review process, not the workflow. With no other routing signal, use `/general-video`. A confirmed sketched `storyboard.html` may itself be the requested deliverable; the review loop defines that stop point.
- Specialized narrative workflows support up to about 3 minutes and are strongest around 30–90s. Route a clearly longer piece to `/general-video`. Length never overrides an explicit port, deck, caption, overlay, or music-driven deliverable.

## 3. Route once, then leave

For fresh creation the intent layer (`references/intent-interview.md`) runs the full conversation — memory, triage, pitch round, must-haves, run-shape, hand-off — and **ends by writing `BRIEF.md`. The brief is the only routing artifact the workflow reads**; nothing later re-opens this skill or the interview. Answer every later "what did the route require?" from `BRIEF.md`.

## 4. Install and enter the workflow

Workflows are bundled with the profile and are never installed or refreshed at run time. Bundled: `/talking-head-recut`, `/embedded-captions`, `/motion-graphics`, `/faceless-explainer`, and `/general-video`.

Not bundled: `/remotion-to-hyperframes`, `/slideshow`, `/music-to-video`, `/pr-to-video`, `/product-launch-video`, and `/figma`. When routing selects one of these, tell the owner it is not bundled in this release, name the closest bundled workflow (usually `/general-video`), and ask whether to proceed with it. Do not download it and do not reconstruct it from memory.

## 5. Load domain skills on demand

Creator edit phrases are cross-domain requests. Load every skill named in the matching row:

| zoom in here, punch-in / punch-out, smooth multi-state zoom or reframe, Ken Burns, or camera move                  | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes`; animate the inner visual/crop wrapper, not the timed clip.                                                     |
| match cut or whip pan camera transition                                                                            | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-animation` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` + `/hyperframes-registry`; search/install a transition primitive before hand-authoring.                    |
| fade, crossfade, track gain/volume, automation, duck/carve, audio effects, or one effect across several tracks     | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-audio`; core places clips, audio mixes placed tracks — including a submix bus over a group of them.                        |
| picture and sound edits that combine cuts with camera motion or mixing                                             | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` when there is visual motion + `/hyperframes-audio` when sound is faded, mixed, ducked, automated, or processed. |
| lay out a project so it reads well in Studio: caption track, tracks per element kind, sub-compositions, safe zones | `/hyperframes-studio` + `/hyperframes-core`; studio owns the layout conventions, core owns each edit.                                                                             |
| source or generate media, or preprocess an unsupported mid-source freeze                                           | `/media-use`; sourcing/generation/preprocessing only, never placed-track mixing.                                                                                                  |

Constant `data-playback-rate` is render-safe for picture and pitch-preserved
sound. Speed ramps are a `rate` lane in `data-automation`.
For copyable edit contracts, load `/hyperframes-core` → `references/creator-editing-recipes.md`.

Broad feedback about how photographic media looks or behaves also routes to
`/media-use`, even when the user never says “color grading” or “effect”: fix
dark/flat/boring footage, stylize a clip, hide a face, or improve a media
reveal. Read `../media-use/references/media-treatments.md` before editing a
treatment; it governs how footage is treated, never whether media may be used.
Do not substitute a generic LUT, CSS filter/overlay, or opacity tween for an
existing canonical treatment primitive. Keep text/layout/motion-only edits in
their owning domain.
During a build with important photographic media, include one grounded
media-polish scan in the final quality pass; leaving suitable media unchanged is
a valid result.

Domain skills never take ownership of the end-to-end deliverable. Load only what the active workflow needs.

## 6. Studio, and the HyperFrames desktop app

The Studio preview is a local editor served on localhost. Start and stop it only through the launcher's `preview-start` and `preview-stop` commands, and stop it when the task ends. The HyperFrames desktop app hand-off is not available in this profile: do not offer it, and do not relay CLI lines that advertise it.
